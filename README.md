# IMS566 – Administration Portal  

A simple web-based administration portal for managing user login and access (admin & staff).  

## 🌟 Project Overview  
This project provides a secure login portal allowing two user roles: **Administration Staff** and regular **Staff**. It includes a login form and uses demo credentials to demonstrate role-based login behavior. The portal is built as a static-hosted web app (via GitHub Pages), making it easy to deploy/demo without backend setup.  

## 🔑 Demo Credentials  
Use these to test the login:  
- Admin: `admin` / `admin888`  
- Staff: `staff` / `staff888`  

## 🛠 How to Use / Demo  
1. Clone or download the repo.  
2. Open `index.html` (or the root URL if hosted on GitHub Pages).  
3. Use one of the demo credentials above to log in.  
4. The portal will present different access levels depending on the login role.  

## 📁 What’s Included  
- `index.html` (login page)  
- Static assets (CSS / JS / images) for styling and functionality  
- No backend — purely client-side (for demo purposes)  

## 📌 Why This Project  
- Useful for demonstrating basic role-based login logic.  
- Easy to deploy and share (no server required).  
- Simple, minimal structure — easy to understand and adapt.  

## ✅ Limitations / Notes  
- This is only a demo/static version — **no real authentication backend**.  
- Demo credentials are hardcoded (not secure).  
- Not suitable for production use without proper backend/auth handling.  

## 📋 Possible Improvements / To-Do  
- Add a backend (e.g. Node.js + database) for real authentication.  
- Improve UI/UX (e.g. input validation, responsive design).  
- Add role-based authorization (more roles, pages, permissions).  
- Use environment variables / secure credential storage instead of hardcoding.  

## 🎯 Intended Audience  
- Students learning about authentication/login flows.  
- Developers experimenting with role-based access in a simple setup.  
- Anyone wanting a quick demo of login logic without setting up a backend.
